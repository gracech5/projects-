# Portfolio
This repository consist of a portfolio of data science projects that I have worked on as part of a Master of Science in Business Analytics course and also for my own self-learning. 



### Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator
Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.

Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
