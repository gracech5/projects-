# Projects
This repository contains a portfolio of projects that I have done as part of a Master of Science in Business Analytics course and for my own self-learning. 


### [Project 1 - Fraud Detection](https://github.com/gracech5/projects-/tree/main/Fraud%20Detection)

- Trained machine learning models to detect vehicle insurance claim fraud
- Key models implemented include: Linear SVM, XGBoost and Balanced Random Forest Models
- Handled imbalanced data using oversampling and undersampling methods such as SMOTE
- Top predictors of fraud are fault, policy type and vehicle category 


### [Project 2 - Effect of Dodd-Frank Act on Trading Asset Ratios](https://github.com/gracech5/projects-/tree/main/Difference%20in%20Difference%20%26%20Propensity%20Score%20Model)

- Estimated the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on affected banks' trading asset ratio 
- Used a Difference-in-Difference model to estimate the impact of the regulation 
- Implemented a Propensity Score model to check for robustness of results 


### [Project 3 - Multi-Armed Bandits](https://github.com/gracech5/projects-/tree/main/Multi-Armed%20Bandits)
