### Fraud Detection 

Supervised machine learning models are trained on a car insurance fraud dataset from Kaggle. As the dataset is imbalanced, oversampling and undersampling tools such as SMOTE from the Imblearn packages are used to improve the performance of the models. The top models chosen based on precision and F1 scores are Linear SVM, XGBoost and Balanced Random Forest models.
