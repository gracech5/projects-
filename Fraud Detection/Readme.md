### Fraud Detection 

Machine learning models are trained on a car insurance fraud dataset from Kaggle. As the dataset is imbalanced, oversampling and undersampling tools such as SMOTE are used from the Imblearn packages which helped to improve the performance of the models significantly. The top models chosen based on precision and F1 scores are Linear SVM, XGBoost and Balanced Random Forest models.
